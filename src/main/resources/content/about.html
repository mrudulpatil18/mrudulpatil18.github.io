    <p>Hey, I’m Mrudul — a <strong><em>software engineer</em></strong> learning and improving in all things CS and
        engineering.</p>
    <p>I'm drawn to systems, structure, and how things work beneath the surface. There’s something compelling about
        understanding things from first principles — the kind of itch that doesn’t go away until it’s resolved.</p>
    <p>This space is for knowledge, ideas, and the occasional rabbit holes.</p>
    <p>Outside of tech, I’m into <em>chess</em>, <em>cricket</em>, and <em>video games</em>.</p>
